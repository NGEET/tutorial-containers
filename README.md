# NGEE tutorial containers

This repository contains the build recipes (i.e. dockerfiles) and associated scripts necessary to build and run a variety of tutorials for the NGEE projects.  They contain builds for both host land model container images as well as analysis containers based on the official [Jupyter Docker Stacks](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Information on how to setup the necessary software for this tutorial can be found via the [tutorial user's guide](https://ngee-tutorial-containers.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

This project is forked from the [NGEE-Arctic 2022 tutorial](https://github.com/TESTgroup-BNL/ngeearctic_elm_containers).  This repo uses branches to archive particular tutorials.
